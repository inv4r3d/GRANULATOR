1. MOVEMENT Section
Controls how the white line (scanner) moves along the sound wave.
SPEED: Scanner movement speed.
0: Freeze. The sound freezes at one point (infinite drone).
Low values: Time-stretch effect.
LFO MOD: Adds oscillation to the movement. The scanner begins to "float" back and forth around the current point. Brings life to static sounds.
2. GRANULATOR Section
Here you adjust the character of the "grains" (sound chunks) themselves.
SIZE: Length of one grain in milliseconds.
Low (10-50ms): Metallic, buzzing, robotic sound.
High (200ms+): Smooth, fuzzy atmospheres (pads).
DENSITY: The interval between bean launches.
Low ms: Beans overlap each other -> Dense wall of sound.
High ms: Individual "drops" are audible -> Rhythmic rain effect.
SPRAY: Random deviation from the scanner position. "Blurs" the sound, making it less clear but more spacious.
REVERSE %: The probability that a bean will be played backwards. Adds mystery and texture.
3. CHAOS & DISTORTION Section (New!)
A block for aggressive sound design.
DISTORTION: Signal overdrive. Makes the sound harsh, loud, and "dirty."
VISUAL: At high values, the screen begins to shake.
GLITCH PROB: The chance of a digital error occurring.
If triggered: The grain abruptly changes speed, becomes very short, or inverts. Creates a "broken file" or IDM rhythm effect.
Visual: The screen flickers and inverts colors.
4. PITCH Section
RATE: The pitch of the grains.
1.0 = Original.
2.0 = Octave up.
0.5 = Octave down.
SUB BASS: The volume of the additional low-frequency sine bass (Sub-oscillator). Adds body and weight to the sound.
SCALE Button: Enables note snapping (pentatonic scale). Useful for always hitting the right notes when playing the Rate parameter.
5. FILTER Section
CUTOFF: Cuts off the high frequencies.
Left: A dull, underwater sound. To the right: a bright, open sound.
RESONANCE: Boosts the frequency at the cutoff point. Adds a sibilant, synth-like quality.
6. SPACE Section
STEREO: Adjusts the width of the stereo base. Spreads the grain across the left and right channels.
DELAY: Echo (delay). Adds repeating reflections.
REVERB: Reverb. Creates the feeling of a large hall or cave.
